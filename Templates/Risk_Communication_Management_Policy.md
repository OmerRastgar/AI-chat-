Risk Communication Management Policy

## Risk Communication Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cybersecurity Risk Communication Policy aims to establish a structured and consistent approach for identifying, assessing, documenting, and communicating cybersecurity risks to key stakeholders within our organization. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for the timely and accurate reporting of cybersecurity risks, ensuring that decision-makers have the necessary information to make informed risk management decisions. This policy seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and risk awareness throughout the organization by implementing effective risk reporting practices. Through standardized risk reporting formats, risk metrics, and risk mitigation recommendations, we strive to enable proactive risk management, prioritize resource allocation, and strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of our organization. We aim to foster a risk-aware culture through regular and comprehensive risk reporting, enable risk-based decision-making, and protect our systems, data, and networks from potential threats.

# Scope

The Cybersecurity Risk Communication Policy applies to all employees, contractors, and stakeholders responsible for assessing, managing, and reporting cybersecurity risks within our organization. This policy encompasses identifying, analyzing, and reporting potential and existing cybersecurity risks, vulnerabilities, and threats that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical systems and data. It sets forth guidelines for risk assessment methodologies, risk classification, and risk reporting formats to ensure consistent and accurate reporting across the organization. The policy mandates the timely reporting of cybersecurity risks to the designated authorities, including executive management, risk management committees, and regulatory bodies, as required. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals involved in cybersecurity risk reporting, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity governance.
