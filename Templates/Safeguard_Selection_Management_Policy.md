Safeguard Selection Management Policy

## Safeguard Selection Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cybersecurity Safeguard Selection Policy aims to establish a systematic and consistent approach to developing, maintaining, and enforcing security policies that align with industry standards, regulatory requirements, and our organization's risk appetite. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for creating, reviewing, approving, disseminating, and enforcing security policies across our organization. By implementing effective policy management practices, this policy seeks to ensure that our security policies remain current, relevant, and enforceable, supporting protecting our systems, data, and networks from potential vulnerabilities and threats. Through a centralized and coordinated process, we aim to promote a culture of security awareness, accountability, and compliance, while enabling the efficient governance of our cybersecurity program.

# Scope

The Cybersecurity Safeguard Selection Policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third-party entities connected to our organization's network infrastructure and information systems. This policy encompasses identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. It outlines the procedures and practices for proactive threat intelligence, security monitoring, incident response, and recovery measures. The policy applies to all devices, systems, applications, and data assets owned or used by the organization. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals, and it is essential to promptly report any potential or actual cybersecurity threats. Any exceptions or deviations from this policy require approval from the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity threat management.
