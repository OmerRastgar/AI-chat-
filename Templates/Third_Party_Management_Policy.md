Third-Party Management Policy

# Third-Party Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Third-Party Risk Management Policy aims to establish a robust and risk-based approach for evaluating, selecting, contracting, and monitoring third-party vendors and partners to ensure the security of our organization's information assets. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for assessing the cybersecurity posture of third parties, managing vendor relationships, and enforcing contractual obligations related to security controls and data protection. By implementing effective third-party management practices, this policy seeks to mitigate the potential risks posed by thirdparty relationships, safeguard our systems, data, and networks from unauthorized access and breaches, and protect our sensitive information's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Through a comprehensive due diligence process, regular monitoring, and ongoing communication, we strive to establish and maintain a trusted ecosystem of third-party providers that align with our security standards, regulatory requirements, and overall risk appetite.

# Scope

The Third-Party Risk Management Policy applies to all employees, contractors, and stakeholders engaging and collaborating with third-party entities with access to the organization's systems, data, or networks. This policy encompasses the assessment, selection, contracting, and ongoing management of third-party vendors, suppliers, partners, and service providers to protect the organization's sensitive information and maintain the integrity of its cybersecurity posture. It sets forth guidelines and procedures for evaluating third parties' cybersecurity capabilities and practices, including due diligence assessments, contractual obligations, and periodic audits. The policy mandates the inclusion of robust cybersecurity controls and requirements within vendor contracts and establishes mechanisms for monitoring, reporting, and remediation of any identified risks or incidents. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals involved in third-party management, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity governance.
