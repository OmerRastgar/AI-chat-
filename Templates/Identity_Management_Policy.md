Identity Management Policy

# Identity Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Identity Management Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for effectively managing and controlling user identities, access privileges, and authentication mechanisms within our organization. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for creating, maintaining, and terminating user accounts, as well as enforcing access controls and authentication standards. By implementing robust identity management practices, this policy seeks to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats. Through strong authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls, and regular access reviews, we strive to ensure that only authorized individuals have appropriate access privileges, protect the confidentiality and integrity of our systems and data, and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. By prioritizing identity management, we strengthen our overall cybersecurity posture, minimize the potential for security incidents, and maintain the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.

# Scope

The Identity Management Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, and stakeholders. It encompasses managing and controlling user identities, access privileges, and authentication mechanisms within our IT infrastructure. This policy covers all accounts and credentials to access organizational systems, applications, and data resources. It sets forth guidelines for user provisioning, access controls, password management, and account lifecycle management to ensure information assets' integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The policy defines procedures for identity verification, role-based access control, single sign-on, and multifactor authentication. It also outlines the responsibilities of individuals involved in identity management processes, including system administrators, IT managers, and identity administrators. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for identity management and cybersecurity governance.

# Policy Sanctions

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action in line with our corporation's human resources procedures. Consequences may range from mandatory refresher training and written warnings to temporary suspension of remote access privileges and, in severe cases, termination of employment or contractual obligations. Individuals could be subject to legal consequences under applicable laws if violations involve illegal activities. These sanctions emphasize the critical importance of cybersecurity, the individual's role in protecting our digital assets, and the potential risks associated with policy violations. Enforcement will be consistent and impartial, with the severity of the action corresponding directly to the seriousness of the breach.
