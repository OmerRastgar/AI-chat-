## Underlying Policies

### Data Retention

Given the legal requirements relating to document retention in respect of financial and business records it is becoming increasingly important that organizations develop policies to support their legal obligations in relation to data retention. In addition, the increasing tendency of companies to conduct transactions and general business via email and over the internet, the importance of an effective electronic and hardcopy data retention regime and archiving system cannot be underestimated.

Please see the company’s data retention policy and Information Classification Matrix. It provides details on data classification, retention, storage and disposal.

### Network Security

Please see the company's System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance Policy.
Also, see the company's Platform Infrastructure Document.

### Public Representation

Staff members are to ensure that they do not represent the company on public forums and social media unless they are specifically assigned to do so by directors to act on behalf of the company. It is essential that no internal information of the company. is publicly displayed on the Internet and not shared with any third party over the internet (such as email) unless a non-disclosure agreement is signed by the third party and the company, and such disclosure is allowed in accordance with:

* The groups Information Security & Governance Policy.
* The information classification matrix.

### Physical Access Control

Please see the company’s Access Control Policy.

### Personal Computers and Media

Only company approved personal computer systems can be connected to the company’s network. Such systems are equipped with the licensed copies of software needed to perform the daily tasks of an employee.
All PC’s, laptops and workstations are secured with a password-protected workstation lockout facility, which is activated when the system is not used for more than 15 minutes. You can also lock your system manually by pressing ‘Ctrl+Alt+Del’ on Windows, or ‘shift+cmd+Q’ on Mac when leaving the system unattended. No unauthorized personal computers can be connected to the company’s Network unless approved by management and appropriate screening is performed on the device. Employees are required to lock their workstations when leaving their desk.

Personal computers and media pertaining to the company are not allowed to leave the company work area without the proper authorization of the management team. All media which is no longer required, is to be properly disposed of as per the company’s Data Retention policy. All portable devices are secured with passwords in order to gain access to the system.

These measures prevent easy access to data on your computer and on the company’s network.

***Rule: Be vigilant when using personal computers.***

* Do not connect external or unauthorized personal computers to the company’s network.
* Always lock your computer when leaving your workplace.
* Never deactivate the workstation lockout facility/screensaver.
* Do not install unauthorized software.
* Respect the intellectual property and copyrights.

Laptop computers can contain a huge amount of the company’s information. Portable computers have a particular risk as they are often transported outside the office and can be targeted by thieves when left in cars, wardrobes, hotels or even stored at home. More important than the theft of the device is the loss of information and knowledge stored on the device.

Each user with a company portable computer must be careful to prevent theft or loss of the device and information and treat it as if it was their own.

***Rule: Handle your laptop with care.***

* Laptops must be protected by power-on and hard disk password to prevent access to information stored on the system when lost or stolen.
* Take proper care of portable computers and any associated storage media such as CD-ROM’s, DVD’s, USB’s, etc., that contain company information.
* Never keep any passwords in any form with your portable computer.
* Make regular backups of important information on your laptop by saving it to the central file server.
* Immediately report loss or theft to Technical Operations team

### User Accounts and Passwords

Please see the company’s Access Control Policy for more details, however, users are provided with a unique user ID (UID) which will identify the individual for the systems and applications he or she has been authorized to access.

The password associated with this UID is a vital security tool to protect all the company’s information. Passwords must be kept secret at all times. They may not be shared with anyone or be available in an easily readable form.

Passwords must be changed at least every 60 days. A password must have at least 8 characters and cannot contain any spaces. It must contain at least 5 alphabetic and 1 non-alphabetic characters. Make use of strong passwords by mixing upper and lower case with numerical characters. The company’s key information systems are supplemented by 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) which should be enabled on all accounts by default.

***Rule: Manage your user ID’s and passwords.***

* User IDs and passwords may not be shared with anyone.
* Safeguard your passwords and in case they are exposed or the owner suspects that the password protection is lost they must be changed immediately.
* Use a password manager like Lastpass.
* Enable 2FA on your systems.

### Software Applications

All the required software which an employee requires to carry out their day to day tasks are pre-installed by the Technical team before the workstation is provided to the employee. If an employee requires the installation of a new application, a request is sent to the technical team and they will prove the authenticity of the application, also ensure that the software has no malicious intent. Should the new software require purchase, this is done by the technical team and provided to the employee.

### Email and Communication Systems

Email has many advantages, but also presents serious risks. Sending emails to the company’s colleagues over the company’s network is relatively safe. However, messages sent via the internet can easily be intercepted, with potential loss of confidentiality.

***Rule: Use email and other communications wisely.***

* Be careful when sending emails to external parties, especially with highly confidential information.
* In case you receive emails from sources outside the company’s network unknown to you, be very careful with such emails and if in doubt contact the help desk for support.
* Be alert for possible viruses when opening attachments in emails.
* Do not send unauthorized or unsolicited emails.
* Do not tamper with email header information or solicit email for others.
* Spam emails are blocked automatically by third party services used by the company. Any Spam emails that still arrive in your mailbox need to be reviewed manually to determine if they are legitimate emails.

Company email is not to be used for personal purposes.
Apart from email, the company makes use of various team collaboration tools such as Slack, github and Google Docs. Team collaboration tools offer a big potential loss of information so care should be taken when used.

* Do not use non-approved team collaboration tools to communicate Company data;
* Always ensure collaboration tools use adequate encryption mechanisms especially when sending Company Data [General|Confidential|Personal];
* Make sure that information is shared with the relevant people only, especially if the intended recipients are not internal employees.
* Periodically review access rights for 3rd parties that you are in control of.
* Be mindful of adding any third party integrations or scripts as they may grant super access to other areas of the software.
* When communicating Company Data [General|Confidential|Personal] use tools that use end-to-end encryption.

As of the date of this policy the Company approved collaboration tools are:-

* Google Apps (including Gmail)
* Slack
* GitHub

### Internet Use and Safe Browsing

The internet is a vast source of information and entertainment. However, browsing the internet allows companies to install ‘cookies’ on your computer, might allow intruders to capture your email address and/or passwords, and might spread viruses and spyware on your computer without your knowledge.

***Rule: Use the internet professionally.***

* Be very careful which sites to visit; the site owner is monitoring you and might leave malicious code on your computer.
* Never download any applications from the internet.
* Do not engage in procuring or transmitting material that is in violation of sexual harassment or hostile workplace laws.
* Using a company computing asset, it is forbidden to access or transmit offensive, obscene or pornographic material.
* Do not submit unauthorized material to newsgroups or discussion groups.

### Visitors and Third Party Physical Access

While hospitality is important for the company, only pre-arranged visitors are allowed to enter the offices.

Only visitors who are attending for business purposes or business related staff events with approval from the management team can be invited onto the company’s premises. If in doubt please contact the management team ahead of arranging any on-site meeting.

### Information Storage and Hardcopies

All information on electronic media poses a particular risk as they are almost impossible to protect against copying, theft or unauthorized reading once they are out of care. It is very important that all confidential documents are kept in secure storage. Be aware that information on electronic media (such as CD/ROMs, DVDs, USB/devices and memory sticks) is always in a readable form.
Thus losing the electronic medium implies by default not only loss of information but also a confidentiality breach.

***Rule: Do not disclose information except to authorized people.***

* The company’s information stored on removable media remains the property of the company (CD’s, DVD’s, tapes, USB/devices, printed reports).
* Never throw away outdated electronic media, always bring the electronic media to the System administrator for professional destruction, when information is no longer required. Also be careful when printing reports with sensitive information: collect them immediately from the printer.
* Media including documentation must be secured in lockable cabinets when not in use.
* Access to personal data is governed by law and should be restricted to authorized people.
* Individuals should take proper care of information stored on portable media.
* Documents stored on portable devices may be password protected in order to mitigate the risk of the information being accessed if stolen.

### Remote Access & Third Party Access

Please see the company Access Control Policy.

### Virus Screening and Removal

All personal computer users must keep the current versions of approved virus screening software enabled on their computers. If Virus screening software is not fit for the purposes that you use your personal computer or has not been installed please consult the Technical Operations mission for guidance. Virus screening software which are endorsed and approved include Mac OSX’s GateKeeper and Microsoft’s Windows Defender.
Users must not abort automatic software processes that update virus signatures. Virus screening software must be used to scan all software and data files coming from either third parties or other groups. This scanning must take place before new data files are opened and before new software is executed. Workers must not bypass or turn off the scanning processes that could prevent the transmission of computer viruses.

If an employee suspects infection by a computer virus, one must immediately stop using the involved computer and inform the person responsible for security (Key official in his/her absence). USBs and other storage media used with the infected computer must not be used with any other computer until the virus has been successfully eradicated. The infected computer must also be immediately isolated from internal networks. Users must not attempt to eradicate viruses themselves. Qualified personnel or consultants must complete this task in a manner that minimizes both data destruction and system downtime.

### Intrusion detection and file monitoring

A HIDS (Host-based intrusion detection system) should be installed on all machines that contain or access sensitive information. This will provides the following:

* Host intrusion detection
* File integrity monitoring
* Log monitoring
* Suspicious process monitoring

Any anomalies detected by HIDS are centrally logged and alerts are triggered according to severity. The HIDS will automatically deny access to users which are flagged as suspicious. This system will prevent unauthorized binary and configuration changes which might lead to malicious code injection or unauthorized access.

### Disposal of Equipment

Equipment which is no longer required by the company should be disposed of in a correct and secure manner. All equipment which contains a means of storing data such as hard drives or flash drives need to have all data erased using ‘zero-fill’ technology to ensure that data from the hard disks can no longer be recovered. All media such as USB drives and CD rom drives need to be correctly destroyed before disposing of such media. All equipment which is disposed of or already sanitized equipment and media should be stored in the disposable media storage room and disposed of in batches when necessary.

### Guidelines for Data Anonymization

Where datasets are necessary for the design, implementation or testing of Information Systems, anonymised data should always be used to remove the inclusion of ‘personal data’. Personal data is data which relates to a living individual who can be identified:

* from those data,or
* from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual.

It is therefore important that all personal data is removed from a dataset before it is distributed either internally or externally. The instigator should consider the following:

* the likelihood of re-identification being attempted e.g. breaking weak encryption keys;
* the likelihood the re-identification would be successful (considering other data sources that may be available) e.g. removing usernames from a log file that still includes a timestamp of access which could be cross referenced from a completely separate source;
* the anonymisation techniques which are available to use e.g. utilizing methods no worse than ‘best practice’; and
* the quality of the data after anonymisation has taken place and whether this will meet the needs of the organization using the anonymised information.

Where in doubt, advice should be sought from the company’s Data Protection Officer.
Unless absolutely necessary, qualitative data sets should not be used for testing due to the complications associated with anonymizing such data. If qualitative data is required for such a purpose than the project team should always seek permission from the company’s Data Protection Officer and provide the methods used for achieving anonymous data. Some examples include:

* redacting individuals’ names from documents;
* blurring video footage to disguise faces;
* electronically disguising or re-recording audio material; and Please see the System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance Policy.
* changing the details in a report (precise place names, precise dates etc.)

### Training and Awareness

See Training Awareness Document. The document covers:

* Provide regular training sessions on security best practices and the importance of information security.
* Include security training as part of the onboarding process for new employees and contractors.
* Conduct ongoing awareness programs to keep staff informed about the latest security threats.
* Encourage a culture of security awareness within the organization.

### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

See Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy. The policy covers:

* Develop and maintain a business continuity plan.
* Ensure the plan covers all critical systems and processes.
* Conduct regular tests of the business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
* Update plans based on test results and changing business needs.
* Implement data backup and restore procedures.
* Regularly test backups to ensure they can be restored when needed.

# Policy Sanctions

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action in line with our corporation's human resources procedures. Consequences may range from mandatory refresher training and written warnings to temporary suspension of remote access privileges and, in severe cases, termination of employment or contractual obligations. Individuals could be subject to legal consequences under applicable laws if violations involve illegal activities. These sanctions emphasize the critical importance of cybersecurity, the individual's role in protecting our digital assets, and the potential risks associated with policy violations. Enforcement will be consistent and impartial, with the severity of the action corresponding directly to the seriousness of the breach.
