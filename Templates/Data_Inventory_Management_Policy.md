Data Inventory Management Policy

## Data Inventory Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Data Inventory Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for identifying, classifying, and managing the data assets within our organization. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for documenting the types, locations, and sensitivity levels of our data and defining ownership and accountability. This policy seeks to enhance data governance, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with privacy regulations and data protection requirements by implementing effective data inventory practices. Through regular data audits, mapping exercises, and classification standards, we strive to improve data visibility, enable effective data protection measures, and minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. By prioritizing data inventory management, we enhance our overall cybersecurity posture, reduce data-related risks, and maintain the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.

# Scope

The Data Inventory Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, and stakeholders and encompasses the systematic identification, classification, and management of all data assets within our IT infrastructure. This policy covers all types of data, including sensitive, personal, confidential, and regulated information. It sets forth guidelines for data discovery, classification, and mapping to understand data assets' location, sensitivity, and ownership. The policy defines procedures for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date data inventory, including retention periods, sharing agreements, and disposal practices. It also outlines the responsibilities of individuals involved in data inventory processes, including data owners, IT administrators, and data stewards. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for data inventory and cybersecurity governance.
