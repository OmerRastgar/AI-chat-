Cloud Service Provider Management Policy

## Cloud Service Provider Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cloud Service Provider Policy is designed to establish a comprehensive and systematic framework for the selection, engagement, and continuous oversight of cloud services within our organization. This policy delineates clear criteria and protocols for evaluating potential cloud service providers, ensuring that they meet our stringent security, privacy, and operational performance standards. By laying out structured due diligence and risk assessment procedures, this policy is instrumental in mitigating the potential risks associated with cloud computing, such as data breaches, service disruptions, and compliance lapses.

# Scope

The Cloud Service Provider Policy applies to all personnel within our organization, including full-time employees, part-time staff, consultants, and external business partners who interact with cloud computing resources. This policy comprehensively encompasses cloud service providers' selection, implementation, and management. It delineates the scope of cloud services across our infrastructure, including but not limited to SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS models. It prescribes the standards for evaluating potential providers' security posture, managing cloud access controls and data protection mechanisms, and integrating cloud services with our existing IT environment. The policy mandates consistent and rigorous assessments to ensure that cloud engagements align with our organizational security requirements, data governance policies, and regulatory compliance mandates. Adherence to this policy is compulsory for all applicable entities within the company, and it necessitates that any exemptions or deviations be formally reviewed and sanctioned by the appointed governance body overseeing cloud strategy and cybersecurity directives.
