Resilience Management Policy

# Resilience Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Resilience Management Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for ensuring the availability, resilience, and timely recovery of our critical systems, data, and networks in the event of a cybersecurity incident or disruption. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for developing, implementing, and testing business continuity plans that address cybersecurity risks and potential threats to our operations. By implementing effective business continuity practices, this policy seeks to minimize the impact of cyber incidents, maintain essential business functions, and protect the interests of our stakeholders. Through proactive risk assessment, incident response planning, and regular testing and evaluation, we strive to mitigate vulnerabilities, reduce downtime, and enable the swift restoration of normal operations in the face of cyber disruptions. By prioritizing business continuity, we ensure the continuity of our services, safeguard our reputation, and maintain the trust of our customers, partners, and employees.

# Scope

The Resilience Management Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, and stakeholders. It encompasses the planning, implementing, and managing strategies to ensure the continuous operation and availability of critical systems, processes, and services during disruptive incidents or disasters. This policy covers the identification of potential risks and vulnerabilities, the development of business impact analyses, the formulation of continuity plans, and the establishment of incident response and recovery procedures. It outlines the roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols during business continuity events and sets guidelines for testing, training, and maintaining readiness. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for business continuity and cybersecurity governance.
