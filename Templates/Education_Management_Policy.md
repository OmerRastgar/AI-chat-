# Education Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cybersecurity Education Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness, knowledge, and responsible behavior throughout our organization. This policy aims to provide guidelines and procedures for developing, implementing, and continuously improving cybersecurity education and awareness programs that empower our employees to recognize, prevent, and respond to potential cyber threats. By prioritizing education and awareness, this policy seeks to enhance the overall security posture of our organization, reduce the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, and foster a sense of shared responsibility for protecting our systems, data, and networks. Through regular training, communication, and engagement initiatives, we strive to cultivate a vigilant and resilient workforce equipped to safeguard our sensitive information and assets in the face of evolving cybersecurity risks.
