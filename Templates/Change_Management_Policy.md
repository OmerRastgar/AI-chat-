## Purpose

At its core, change management is the method and process for making changes to an organization's IT systems. This Change Management Policy (CMP) establishes management direction and high-level objectives for change management and control. It ensures the implementation of strategies to mitigate associated risks, such as information corruption or destruction, disruption or degradation of computer performance, productivity losses, and exposure to reputational risk.

The policy communicates management's intent that changes to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-supported business processes will be managed and implemented to minimize risk and impact to the organization and its operations. By reducing errors during changes to IT systems, the CMP helps minimize disruptions, supports the development of a comprehensive Information Security Policy, and promotes a clear, controlled process for requesting, approving, communicating, logging, and testing changes.

## Scope

This policy applies to all parties operating within the organization's network environment or utilizing information resources, with no exemptions for employees, contractors, or other stakeholders.

It covers data networks, local servers, personal computers (stand-alone or network-enabled), laptops, mobile devices, and servers located at offices and depots under the organization's ownership or authorized to access its data networks.

The policy documentation includes the CMP and related procedures and guidelines. Records generated as part of the CMP shall be retained for 2 years in hard copy or electronic media, owned by respective system administrators, and audited annually.

The CMP shall be distributed to all covered employees, with changes and new releases made available to relevant persons. Maintenance responsibility lies with the IT Manager and system administrators. The document is considered 'confidential' and accessible only to authorized individuals with proper controls.

## Definitions

To ensure clarity, the following key terms are defined:

* **Change Management:** The process of controlling modifications to IT systems to minimize risks and disruptions.

* **Baseline Configuration:** A documented snapshot of the information system's standard setup and components.

* **Change Request Form:** A standardized form used to initiate and document proposed changes.

* **Implementation Plan:** A detailed outline of steps for executing a change, including testing and rollback strategies.

* **Stakeholders:** Individuals or departments affected by or involved in a proposed change.

## Responsibilities

* **IT Manager:** Responsible for the proper implementation of the policy; ensures changes follow the change management process; reviews the change management schedule monthly and quarterly to verify compliance.

* **Change Management Controller:** Manages the review of change requests, gathers information, coordinates stakeholders, develops specifications and implementation plans, and oversees pre-change, change, and post-implementation activities.

* **Department Managers:** Notify affected staff, assign actions, ensure testing and documentation, and participate in reviews.

* **Employees and Contractors:** Adhere to the policy, submit change requests via formal processes, and report issues promptly.

* **Auditors (Internal and External):** Examine change management documentation on an agreed time period (e.g., annually) and provide recommendations.

## Policy Statements

Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a formal change control process. This process ensures that proposed changes are reviewed, authorized, tested, implemented, and released in a controlled manner, with ongoing monitoring of each change's status.

To fulfill this policy, the following statements shall be adhered to:

* A current baseline configuration of the information system and its components shall be developed, documented, and maintained.

* A current inventory of the information system components, along with ownership details, shall be developed, documented, and maintained.

* The baseline configuration shall be updated as an integral part of information system component installations.

* Changes to the information system shall be authorized, documented, and controlled using formal change control procedures.

* Configuration changes shall be monitored through verification and audit processes.

* The information system shall be configured to provide only essential capabilities, prohibiting or restricting specific functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, with a defined list of prohibited items.

* The component inventory shall be updated as part of installations.

* Automated mechanisms or tools shall be employed to maintain an up-to-date, complete, reliable, accurate, and readily available system configuration.

* Automated mechanisms or tools shall initiate change requests, notify approval authorities, and record approval and implementation details.

* The information system shall be reviewed at a defined frequency to identify and eliminate unnecessary functions, ports,protocols, and/or services.

* All communications for compliance purposes must be in writing (e.g., email or meeting minutes), retained by the IT Manager, and filed with change documentation. Verbal requests or authorizations are not acceptable.

## Change Procedures

### Risk Considerations

Uncontrolled changes may negatively impact business operations, prevent role fulfillment, or expose the organization to fraud. Proper control ensures awareness of impacts across departments.

### Submitting the Change Request Form

Complete a ChangeRequest Form, available at [e.g., internal shared drive or portal location]. Provide detailed information in the 'Request details' section, including any affected departments and their managers. Email the completed form to [e.g., change.management@organization.com] for logging and forwarding to the Change Management Controller for scheduling.

### Reviewing the Specification

The Change Management Controller reviews the form, gathers additional information, adds affected department managers, arranges meetings, and creates a detailed specification of the change. This specification is sent to all stakeholders for review and approval via email. The Controller also discusses and assigns an appropriate change rating with stakeholders to determine compliance level and priority.

### The Implementation Plan

The implementation plan outlines all stages for successful change management, including a Test Plan, Roll Back Strategy, and potentially a project schedule or timeline. Stakeholders review the plan, suggest amendments to the Change Management Controller, note timelines, training, testing impacts, and dependent tasks, and authorize it via email.

### Pre-Change Activities

Once approved, department managers notify affected staff, assign actions, communicate the Roll Back Strategy, provide Test Plan copies to testers (ensuring documentation retention), and lia-ise with stakeholders and the Change Management Controller to confirm progress.

### Executing the Change

To minimize disruption, follow the implementation plan closely. Highlight any issues to the Change Management Controller immediately for coordination and communication among stakeholders.

### Post-Implementation Review

Conduct a post-implementation review one month after live promotion (or sooner if issues arise) to identify problems or improvements. Perform a further review two months post-implementation. The IT Manager reviews documentation and follow-up materials quarterly, with minutes and actions filed. Internal and external auditors examine documentation on an agreed time period (e.g., annually), acting on their recommendations.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy must be documented and formally approved by the IT Manager and the organization. Exceptions must describe the nature, a reasonable explanation, associated risks, and evidence of approval by all appropriate parties.

# Policy Sanctions

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action in line with our corporation's human resources procedures. Consequences may range from mandatory refresher training and written warnings to temporary suspension of remote access privileges and, in severe cases, termination of employment or contractual obligations. Individuals could be subject to legal consequences under applicable laws if violations involve illegal activities. These sanctions emphasize the critical importance of cybersecurity, the individual's role in protecting our digital assets, and the potential risks associated with policy violations. Enforcement will be consistent and impartial, with the severity of the action corresponding directly to the seriousness of the breach.
