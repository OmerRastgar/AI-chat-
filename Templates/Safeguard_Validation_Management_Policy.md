Safeguard Validation Management Policy

## Safeguard Validation Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cybersecurity Safeguard Validation Policy aims to establish a systematic and comprehensive framework for planning, conducting, and managing cybersecurity audits within our organization. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for assessing the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls, identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and ensuring compliance with industry standards, legal regulations, and internal policies. By implementing effective audit management practices, this policy seeks to enhance our cybersecurity governance, identify areas for improvement, and mitigate potential risks and threats. Through regular audits and independent assessments, we strive to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our systems, data, and networks while continuously improving our security posture and demonstrating our commitment to security to stakeholders.

# Scope

The Cybersecurity Safeguard Validation Policy applies to all employees, contractors, and stakeholders involved in conducting and managing cybersecurity audits within our organization. This policy encompasses the planning, execution, and oversight of audits to evaluate cybersecurity controls and processes' effectiveness, compliance, and maturity. It covers internal and external audits, including regulatory compliance audits, vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and security risk assessments. The policy establishes guidelines for audit planning, scoping, resource allocation, documentation, and reporting. It ensures that audit findings are addressed, remediation plans are developed, and continuous improvement is fostered. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals involved in Cybersecurity Safeguard Validation, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity governance.
