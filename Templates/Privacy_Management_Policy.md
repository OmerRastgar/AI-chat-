# Privacy Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Data Privacy Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive data entrusted to our organization. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for data collection, storage, use, disclosure, and disposal in compliance with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and industry best practices. By implementing effective data privacy practices, this policy seeks to ensure the lawful and ethical handling of personal information, safeguard the rights and privacy of individuals, and maintain the trust and confidence of our customers, partners, and stakeholders. Through robust data protection measures, privacy impact assessments, and ongoing monitoring, we strive to mitigate the risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of personal information while fostering transparency, accountability, and compliance in our data handling practices.

It outlines procedures for obtaining consent, implementing security measures to safeguard data, ensuring data accuracy, and responding to data subject rights requests. The policy sets forth guidelines for data breach notification, data sharing agreements, and vendor management to protect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' information. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for data privacy and cybersecurity governance.
