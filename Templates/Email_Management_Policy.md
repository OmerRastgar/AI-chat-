Email Management Policy

# Email Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Email Management Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework for filtering and monitoring incoming and outgoing email traffic within our organization. This policy provides clear guidelines and procedures for implementing email filtering technologies to enforce security controls, protect against email-borne threats, and mitigate the risk of phishing attacks, malware infections, and data breaches. By implementing robust email filtering practices, this policy seeks to minimize the exposure to malicious emails, spam, and other potentially harmful content, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. By configuring appropriate filtering rules, continuous monitoring, and regular updates, we strive to protect against emerging threats, reduce the risk of social engineering attacks, and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. By prioritizing email filtering, we enhance our overall cybersecurity posture, safeguard sensitive information, and maintain the trust and confidence of our stakeholders.

# Scope

The Email Management Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, and stakeholders. It encompasses implementing and managing email filtering measures to protect against spam, malware, phishing attempts, and other email-borne threats. This policy covers all email communications sent or received by individuals within the organization, regardless of the email client or device used. It sets forth guidelines for configuring and maintaining email filtering technologies, such as spam filters, antivirus scanners, and content analysis systems. The policy defines procedures for blocking or quarantining malicious or suspicious emails and educating employees on recognizing and reporting potential email threats. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all individuals within the organization, and any deviations or exceptions require approval from the designated authority responsible for email filtering and cybersecurity governance.
