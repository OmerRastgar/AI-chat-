# Program Management Policy

## (Last Updated April 2025)

# Purpose

Our Cybersecurity Program Management Policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our organization's information assets. This policy seeks to protect our systems, data, and networks from unauthorized access, misuse, and potential threats while promoting responsible and secure practices throughout the organization. By implementing robust governance measures, this policy seeks to mitigate risks, enhance the resilience of our infrastructure, foster a culture of security awareness, and align our cybersecurity efforts with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. Through effective governance, we strive to maintain the trust of our stakeholders, safeguard our reputation, and safeguard the sensitive information entrusted to us.

# Scope

The Cybersecurity Program Management Policy applies to all our organization's employees, contractors, vendors, and stakeholders, irrespective of their roles or responsibilities. This policy encompasses all aspects of cybersecurity governance, including strategic planning, risk management, compliance, incident response, and continual improvement. It establishes a framework to guide the organization in effectively managing and mitigating cybersecurity risks, protecting critical information assets, and ensuring sensitive data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The policy outlines the responsibilities and accountabilities of individuals within the organization for maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture, complying with relevant laws and regulations, and adhering to industry best practices. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all personnel, and any exceptions or deviations must be approved by the designated authority responsible for cybersecurity governance.
