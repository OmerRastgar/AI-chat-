# Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

## Introduction

Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for the “Department” is prepared to provide an action plan to ensure maximum resilience of the critical services is maintained and the recovery of most of the processes can be managed utilizing the minimum resources. Recovery strategies and Recovery resource requirement defined to for this plan are based on the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for the “Department”

## Purpose of the document

The existence of this plan alone does not guarantee successful recovery capability of critical services. The preparedness to respond to a disaster implies a continuous and ongoing effort to ensure it reflects business reality. This BCP document will have to be kept current as personnel, equipment and facilities currently present at the organization may change in due course of time. Further, participants in the business recovery must be aware of their roles and responsibilities in executing the plan. Thus the purpose of proactively developing a BCP and making the respective personnel aware of the requirements is to ensure that the company can respond effectively to disruptions to critical business processes and recover them within the acceptable time limits.

## Business Continuity Planning

### Objective

Business Continuity plan provides guidelines and action items to recover the critical processes following a disaster. The main objectives of the BCP is to;

* Implement recovery strategies for continuance of business
* Recover all critical processes within defined time frame
* Provide effective Coordination to mobilize required resource for recovery
* Communication to key stakeholders during recovery period
* Ensure procedures are followed to return to normalcy

### Business Impact Analysis

Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is performed across organizational department to determine the criticality of each service. The BIA analyzes the critical business functions, to identify and quantify the impact (i.e. Operational, financial, reputational) a disruption of these services may have on the organization and/or to its stakeholders. The following table provides the services listed for department through BIA.

#### Service Criticality Matrix

| Recovery Point Objective | Recovery Time Objective: <= 2 Hours | RTO: > 2 to <= 4 Hours | RTO: > 4 to <= 8 Hours | RTO: > 8 to <= 24 Hours | RTO: > 24 Hours |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Disaster Scenario
### Defining a disaster
A disaster is an event (predictable or unpredictable), that causes threat to the normal functioning of the Department, functions and services, which is not planned for as part of day to day operations.
The outcome of such disaster events may require a combination of one or more of the following actions to enable delivery of critical products and services at a minimum to stakeholders.

* Short-term downsizing of operations (service degradation or Transaction level priority)
* Alternate ways of performing the business processes
* Redistribution, i.e., allocation of resources to meet business commitments at a minimum acceptable level

### Identified Disaster Scenarios
The disaster scenarios considered for this plan fall under the following risk categories:

* **Natural disasters:** Calamities such as earthquake, floods, storms etc.
* **Socio-political risks:** civil disturbance, strikes etc.
* **Deliberate threats:** Terrorist attacks, sabotage, arson etc.
* **Technology risks:** Loss of internet connectivity, communication, server failure etc.
* **Accidents and mishaps:** Staff vehicle accidents, fire etc.

### Disaster Outcome Mapping
Disaster outcome mapping is intended to identify and establish plausible outcomes of a disaster. It serves as an indicator for defining proactive recovery strategies and measures to ensure operational continuity. The disaster scenarios identified for this plan have one or more of the following key outcomes:

* **Office premises not available:** Natural and man-made disasters such as floods, fire, earthquake, etc. leading to partial or complete damage of office building/infrastructure
* **Staff not available:** Personnel related events such as mass exodus or accidents leading to the unavailability of staff to perform/facilitate key business operations
* **Disruption of communication / technology (localized):** Events like internal IT systems failure, fire, flood in basements, terrorist attacks or bomb blasts leading to the unavailability of technology and communication systems
* **Vendor unable to provide services:** Disasters affecting vendor sites/operations/staff leading to disruption of critical services to facilitate operations

## Business Continuity Strategies
Business Continuity strategy or Recovery measures are designed to enable the organization to effectively continue its critical operations in the event of a disaster.

| Recovery Strategy | Availability | Implementation Status (Planned/ In-progress /Complete) * |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Annexures
### Business Continuity Strategies
Business Continuity Strategies are the measures taken by management in order to plan a recovery process following a disaster. The strategies are developed according to the recovery objective of the services and feasibility of implementing them. Following are the strategies explained to guide the departments to choose one or multiple strategies for each service relevant to their recovery objectives.

**Split Operation / Diverse sites**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Undertaking of activities for delivering service at two or more geographically dispersed sites so that operations can be switched from one to another. Both sites capable of delivering all critical services of the department | • Office premises not available<br>• Staff not unavailable<br>• Disruption of commute<br>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized) |

**Alternate Site/ Standby facilities**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dedicated recovery operations facilities (hot /warm sites) pre-identified to enable timely and immediate recovery of operations | • Office premises not available<br>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized) |

**Multiple Vendor/Subcontract**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Proactive multi-vendor service model adopted (for business as usual) to minimize concentration risk and impact of service downtime | • Vendor unable to provide services |

**Transactional level pre-prioritization of services l service Degradation**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Recovery of affected critical processes by reducing operations of a “lesser” critical process at an alternate site (for creating “seating” capability). The recovery option maybe considered as an immediate short term recovery option until alternate recovery arrangements maybe implemented | • Office premises not available<br>• Staff not available<br>• Disruption of commute<br>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized) |

**Remote Access: Issue of laptops and VPN Connectivity**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Set up of infrastructure for VPN deployment and assigning of teams/individuals to enable remote-access delivery | • Office premises not available<br>• Disruption of commute<br>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized) |

**Assign staff with Cross Functional Training**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Utilization of cross functional capabilities within teams to undertake key activities/processes of affected services | • Office premises not available<br>• Staff not available<br>• Disruption of commute<br>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized)<br>• Vendor unable to provide services) |

**Temporary Site Creation**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| A new site is identified to enable recovery of operations until the primary site is fully recovered | • Office premises notB<D>• Disruption of communication / technology (localized) |

**Manual procedures and Workaround**
| Strategy Description | Disaster Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Manual procedures are developed to continue minimum services when IT systems are not available | • Disruption of communication / technology |

### Business Continuity Steps Guidelines:

#### Business Continuity Scenario 1 - Unavailability of Primary Site
* Business Continuity Administration team to inform the IT recovery team to arrange for IT infrastructure at the alternate site
* If staff from the primary site are required at the alternate site; staff to be informed through phone by the BCM coordinator to reach the alternate site and support operations <with specific instruction> from alternate location
* Respective staff to reach the alternate site and start working
* If cross functional is an option; where team members from a different team are assigned to recover a critical process based on the recovery time objective; e.g.: Key Staff from 2 or more department/section can work together on process recovery with shared resources and ask the given staff member to work on multiple tasks across processes
* The staff to support operations till business continuity is revoked
* In other cases, wait till the issue is solved and primary site is recovered. (service degradation)
* BC Manager/ BCP Admin team to obtain regular updates from the BCM Coordinators till the Business continuity implemented is revoked

#### Business Continuity Scenario 2 - Unavailability of Technology/Communications
* BC Manager to inform the IT recovery team to arrange for IT infrastructure at the alternate site
* If the disruption is due to partial failure of IT systems, the teams are advised to follow Manual Work Around steps; teams are instructed to attend to phone request and orders, data in physical form are used to process the transactions. The records and reports are prepared manually to update the IT system at a later time after they are fully recovered
* If the staff from the primary site is required at the alternate site, staff to be informed through phone by the BCM coordinator to reach the alternate site and support operations <instruction> from alternate location
* Respective Staff to reach the alternate site and start working
* If cross functional is an option; where team members from a different team are assigned to recover a critical process based on the recovery time objective e.g.: Key Staff from 2 or more department/section can work together on process recovery with shared resources and ask the given staff member to work on multiple tasks across processes
* The staff to support operations till the business continuity is revoked
* In other cases, wait till the issue is solved and primary site is recovered (service degradation)
* BC Manager to will obtain regular updates from the BCM Coordinator till the Business continuity is revoked

#### Business Continuity Scenario 3 - Unavailability of Staff
* If cross trained staff is available at another location BCM Coordinator to contact the team lead or manager at the alternate location and instruct the team to start the operations or take up additional tasks from affected site
* Teams which are serviced by third party vendor to arrange for additional/ temporary staff during the business continuity phase (backup teams and multiple vendor engagement)
* In other cases, wait till the issue is solved and primary site is recovered
* BC Manager to will obtain regular updates from the BCM Coordinator till the Business continuity is revoked
